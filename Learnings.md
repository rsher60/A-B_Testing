Q1) What is statisctical power?
Ans : Statistical Power is used to report confidence in the conclusions drawn from results of an 
     experiment. It can also be used for estimating the sample size required for the experiment 
     the sample size required for the experiment ie sample size in which with a give level of confidence - we should be 
    able to detect any change.

Q2) What factors depend on the sample size calculation?
Ans : The sample size calculation depends on the power, the distribution , the minimum detectable 
    effect.

Q3) Define significance level, p-value , Type 1 and Type 2 error.


Q4) Differntiate between practical significance and statistical significance?
Q5) what is effect size? 
Ans: Effect size is the quantified magnitude of a phenomenon present in the population.Effect
size can be calculated using different metrics depending on the context , for example :
a) Pearson correlation b) Regression coefficient c) difference between two groups eg. Cohen's d
It makes a relative comparision; the size of the treatment effect relative to the difference expected
by chance. If the standard error is very small, then the treatment effect can also be very small and still be bigger
than chance.
Therefore a significant effect does not necessarily mean a big effect.
Also, if the sample size is large enough, any treatment effect, no matter how small can be enough
for us to reject the null hypothesis.
